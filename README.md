## Overview

This is a data-driven web application called 'The Book Stop' that acts like a book library for users. Each user creates
a profile then can insert and remove books their collection from the library. Each book has a genre that can be searched to catergorise the books.

## UX

## Strategy Plane

The purpose for this website came from an idea of my friends and I to have a place to share books we recommend.
This Data Driven Web-application was built to share books with other users with the same genre interests.

## Scope Plane

Taking into account that that users will visit my site to look specifically on visual data I want the main attention
focusing on the graphs themselves. Therefore, little content as possible is required to suffice the goal.


## Structure Plane

Before I started my project I created a mockup using Adobe XD (image below). I understood that this was the foundation of my
site as other ideas would come to mind when progressing with the project.

This is the overall structure that I wanted, as the content is minimal with only the chart description and charts availble for the user to look at. Also, I want 
padding around each peice of content to create more of a spacious effect so the user isn't overwhemled with infomation or content.

## Interaction Design

The menu situated (top right on mobile) assists the user in navigating through the website.

## Surface Plane

The typogragphy was found on google fonts and I chose the font <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway">Raleway</a> as it
has nice soft-rounded edges and also has 18 different font variants.

The color scheme I chose for this project is seen below:

 - #fff191 ( Main color of the website )
 - #8e9195 ( Footer color )
 - #60a6f0 ( Main Button Color )

## Testing

I tested this project manually.

## Manual Testing

1. All forms work as expected.

2. Responsiveness works on all devices

3. Both Drop Down Menu's successfully change all graphs accordingly.

4. Each Chart Interacts with each other successfully.

I also used Google Developer Tools to simulate a mobile to help me see the responsiveness.

There are zero errors in the published console log.

-----

## Deployment

The version control and deployment of this project is based on Git Hub. After every session I push the local code within Cloud9 into my GIT HUB repository.


This is my procedure: 

After I have finished working on the files in my IDE I would open the terminal and do the following commands to push the updated files across to the repository on GitHub

``` $git add . ```

```$git commit -m "describe the stage I am at"```

```git push -u origin master```

I would now ```$git status``` to check if everything is finished and then look at the repository to see there aswell.
